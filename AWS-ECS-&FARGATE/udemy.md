Course Prerequisites:
- Dockerfile, creating images 
- Running containers
- Port mappings
- Push and pull from repository 
- Volume mounting 
- basic knowledge of aws 
- aws networking
- IAM roles and permissions

Docker:
- The docker daemon allows for the management of Docker containers, images, networks, and volumes on a host system. It listens for API requests from clients and handles the creation, execution, and orchestration of containers.
- it works with the docker agent to manage the containers on the host.
- The containers can talk to each other over a virtual network created by Docker.
- Docker images are stored in docker repositories. ex docker hub
- Amazon has its own private repository service called Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry).
- Docker Hub is a public registry that anyone can use to share their Docker images.
- Whats the difference between Docker and virtual machine
- Docker containers are lightweight and share the host OS kernel, while virtual machines include the entire OS and are more resource-intensive.
- For virtual machine you install the guest os on top of the host os using the hypervisor.
- The docker daemon is installed on the host os and it manages the containers.
- With the hypervisor you are limited to the os you install on the vm
- Each VM runs its own OS kernel on top of the hypervisor.
- Efficient scaling: You can run many more containers on the same hardware vs VMs.
- The docker daemon allows for the management of Docker containers, images, networks, and volumes on a host system. It listens for API requests from clients and handles the creation, execution, and orchestration of containers.

What is ECS:
 - It stands for Elastic Container Service.
 - We use ECS to launch container services.
 - For ECS you provision and maintain the infrastructure but aws takes care of starting and stopping the containers.
 - ECS knows where to add the server resources based on demand but you still need to manage those EC2 instances manually
 - You can integrate application load balancers with ECS to distribute traffic across your containers.
 - It is a fully managed container orchestration service provided by AWS.
 - It allows you to run and manage Docker containers on a cluster of EC2 instances.
 - ECS takes care of the heavy lifting involved in deploying and managing containers, such as scaling, load balancing, and monitoring.

What is Fargate:
 - Still allows you to launch docker containers on AWS without managing the underlying infrastructure. This is done by AWS
 - AWS runs all the containers based on the cpu and ram that you need. 
 - All of this is done in the backend by AWS
 - It is a serverless compute engine for containers.
 - It allows you to run containers without having to manage the underlying infrastructure.
 - With Fargate, you don't need to provision or manage EC2 instances.
 - You only pay for the resources that your containers use.
 - Fargate automatically scales your containers based on demand.
 - It integrates with ECS and EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service).
 - It is a good choice for applications with variable workloads or unpredictable traffic patterns.

ECS VS EKS VS Beanstalk:
 - ECS is a container orchestration service for managing Docker containers on a cluster of EC2 instances.
 - EKS is a managed Kubernetes service for running Kubernetes clusters on AWS. Docker on AWS but running on Kubernetes. Open source tool for container orchestration.
 - Beanstalk is a platform as a service (PaaS) for deploying and managing applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
 
ECS Clusters:
- ECS Clusters are a logical grouping of EC2 instances or Fargate tasks where you can run your containerized applications.
- You can have multiple clusters for different environments (e.g., dev, staging, prod) or applications.
- Each cluster can contain one or more services and tasks.
- Clusters help you organize and manage resources, networking, and security boundaries for your containers.
- EC2 instances run the ECS agent(Docker container)
- The ECS Agents register the instances to the ECS Cluster
- The EC2 instances Run a special AMI made specifically for ECS.
- There are 4 roles to make note of: 
- There is an ecs-instance-role which allows ec2 instances in an ECS cluster to access ECS and ecs-role which allows ECS to create and manage AWS resources on your behalf
- The ecs-instance-role is attached to the EC2 instances running in the ECS cluster, while the ecs-role is used by the ECS service itself.
- The ecs-instance-role typically has permissions to pull container images from Amazon ECR, log to Amazon CloudWatch, and communicate with the ECS service.
- The ecs-role typically has permissions to create and manage AWS resources on your behalf, such as creating load balancers, scaling groups, and other resources needed for your containerized applications.
- The ecs-instance-role is used by the EC2 instances in the ECS cluster, while the ecs-role is used by the ECS service itself.
- The ecs-role is typically assumed by the ECS service when it needs to create or manage AWS resources on your behalf.
- The ecs-role is also used to grant permissions to other AWS services that need to interact with your ECS tasks and services.
- The ecs-role is created with the necessary permissions and trust relationships to allow the ECS service to assume it.
- The ecs-instance-role has a trust relationship with ec2.amazonaws.com, allowing EC2 instances to assume the role.
- There is a ecs-task execution role which allows ECS tasks to call AWS services on your behalf.
- The role has a trust with ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com, allowing ECS tasks to assume the role.
- Last role is the ecs-autoscaling role which allows Auto Scaling to access and update ECS services.

An Amazon ECS cluster is basically a logical group of compute resources (either EC2 instances or Fargate tasks) where your Docker containers run.
Think of it like this:
ECS (Elastic Container Service) is AWS’s container orchestration service (similar to Kubernetes, but managed by AWS).
An ECS Cluster is a pool of resources where you deploy your containerized applications.
Key points about an ECS Cluster:
It doesn’t run anything by itself — it’s just the grouping mechanism.
You choose how the cluster is backed:
EC2 Launch Type → Your containers run on EC2 instances you manage.
Fargate Launch Type → AWS manages the servers for you (serverless containers).
Inside the cluster, you run:
Tasks → A single running copy of a container (or multiple containers defined together in a task definition).
Services → A way to keep a set number of tasks running (like “always keep 3 replicas of this web app running”).
ECS integrates with ALBs/NLBs for load balancing and CloudWatch for logging/metrics.
Clusters can span multiple Availability Zones in a region, giving you high availability.
Creating an EC2 based cluster:
1. Open the Amazon ECS console.
2. Choose "Clusters" from the navigation pane.
3. Choose "Create Cluster".
4. Select "EC2 Linux + Networking" or "EC2 Windows + Networking" depending on your needs.
5. Configure the cluster settings, including the cluster name, instance type, and number of instances.
6. Choose "Create" to create the cluster.
- The ec2 instance shows under infrastructure under the cluster
- You can view and manage your cluster resources from the ECS console.


Creating a Fargate based cluster:
1. Open the Amazon ECS console.
2. Choose "Clusters" from the navigation pane.
3. Choose "Create Cluster".
4. Select "Fargate" as the launch type.
5. Configure the cluster settings, including the cluster name and any other options.
6. Choose "Create" to create the cluster.
- The Fargate tasks will run without the need for EC2 instances.
- You can view and manage your cluster resources from the ECS console.

ECS Task Definition:
    - This is the blueprint of our container
    - Written in JSON or YAML format
    - it contains crucial information like image name, port binding for container and host, environment variables, cpu and memory requirements, networking mode, logging configuration, and IAM roles.
    - You need the ecs instance role to allow the ecs agent to register itself to the ecs service
EC2 instance profile:
    - Used by the ECS agent to make API calls to the ECS service.
    - Send container logs to cloudwatch logs 
    - Pull Docker images from ECR
ECS Task role: 
    - Allow each task to have a specific role 
    - Use different roles for different ECS service you run 
    - Task roles is defined in the task definition 
    - Allows the container to interact with other AWS services.
    - You can specify the task role in the task definition.
    - The task role is assumed by the containers in the task.
ECS Service:
    - ECS service helps define how many tasks should run and how they should run 
    - They ensure that the number of tasks desired is running across our fleet of ec2 instances 
    - They can be linked to a load balancer for distributing traffic
    - You can run a task without ECS service but it is not recommended for production workloads in case you want to scale your application.
    - ECS services can also be configured to use service discovery for easier communication between services.
Task definition:
    - A task definition is a blueprint for your application.
    - It specifies the container images to use, CPU and memory requirements, networking mode, and IAM roles.
    - Task definitions are written in JSON or YAML format.
    - You can version your task definitions, allowing you to roll back to previous versions if needed.
    - To create a task definition, you can use the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or SDKs.
    - Using the console:
        1. Open the Amazon ECS console.
        2. Choose "Task Definitions" from the navigation pane.
        3. Choose "Create new Task Definition".
        4. Select the launch type (EC2 or Fargate).
        5. Configure the task definition settings, including container definitions, resource requirements, and IAM roles.
        6. Choose "Create" to create the task definition.

CloudShell
Feedback
- You can use CloudShell to run aws cli commands without having to install the cli on your local machine.
Creating a task:
 - To create a task using the AWS console, follow these steps:
    1. Open the Amazon ECS console.
    2. Choose "Clusters" from the navigation pane.
    3. Select the cluster where you want to run the task.
    4. Choose the "Tasks" tab.
    5. Click on "Run new Task".
    6. Select the launch type (EC2 or Fargate).
    7. Choose the task definition you want to use.
    8. Configure the task settings, including the number of tasks, networking, and IAM roles.
    9. Click on "Run Task" to start the task.
- Network mode bridge means that the container will share the host's network stack, allowing it to communicate with other containers and the host using localhost.
🔹 Bridge Mode in ECS
Your container runs behind the Docker daemon’s NAT bridge network on the EC2 host.
The container does not get its own ENI (Elastic Network Interface). Instead, it shares the host’s ENI.
ECS manages port mappings between the container and the host.
Example:
Container listens on port 80
ECS can map it to host port 32768 (dynamic)
Traffic → Host ENI:32768 → Container:80
🔹 Characteristics
✅ Good for multiple containers per EC2 host (you can map different host ports → same container port across tasks).
✅ Works in EC2 launch type.
❌ Not supported in Fargate (Fargate only supports awsvpc).
❌ Can be harder to manage security and service discovery, because containers don’t have their own IP addresses.
🔹 Comparison with other modes
awsvpc (preferred now): Each task gets its own ENI + IP in the VPC. Best for isolation & security. Required in Fargate.
host: Container uses the host’s network stack directly (no port mapping, container port = host port).
bridge: Containers sit behind Docker’s NAT bridge; requires explicit port mapping.
👉 In ECS, you’ll mostly see bridge mode in older EC2-based clusters or when you need port-mapped, NAT-style networking.
👉 For new deployments (especially with Fargate), AWS strongly recommends awsvpc mode.
In awsvpc mode:
Each task (not just the container) gets its own Elastic Network Interface (ENI) in the VPC.
That ENI has its own private IP address (and public IP if you assign one).
Containers inside the task can listen directly on their ports (like port 80 or 443) — no need for host port mapping.
Example
You run a container with a web app on port 80.
ECS gives the task its own IP: 10.0.2.45.
You can reach it directly at 10.0.2.45:80.
No need to map through the EC2 host like in bridge mode.
Why it’s useful
✅ Each task is like its own mini virtual machine on the network.
✅ Security groups can be attached per task, not just at the EC2 instance level.
✅ Works perfectly with Fargate (since tasks run without you managing EC2s).
So yeah — in awsvpc you just use the task’s IP and container port directly, instead of doing port juggling like in bridge.

ECS Task placement Process:
- When a task is launched, ECS evaluates the available resources in the cluster.
- It considers factors like CPU, memory, and any task placement constraints.
- ECS then places the task on an appropriate container instance (for EC2 launch type) or provisions a new Fargate task.
- ECS needs to figure out the best placement strategy based on the task requirements and cluster resources.
- This only works for ec2 launch type and not fargate 
- Task placement strategies are best effort
- when amazon ecs places tasks, it uses the following process to select a container instances:
  1. Identify the instances that satisfy the cpu, memory and port requirements in the task definition
  2. Identify the instances that satisfy the task placement constraints
  3. Identify the instances that satisfy the task placement strategies
  4. Select onf of the instances for task placement 

ECS Task placement strategies:
- binpack: Place tasks based on the least available amount of CPU/Memory. This is useful for maximizing resource utilization.
- spread: Distribute tasks evenly across all available instances. This is useful for high availability.
- random: Place tasks on any available instance. This is useful for testing and development.
- They can all be mixed and matched based on your needs.

ECS Task placement constraints:
- distinctInstance: Place tasks on distinct container instances. This is useful for spreading tasks across multiple instances.
- memberOf: Place tasks on instances that are part of a specific capacity provider or cluster.
- maxPods: Limit the number of tasks that can be placed on a single instance.

ECS Networking modes:
- bridge: The default networking mode. Containers get an internal IP address and communicate with the host using port mappings.
- host: Containers share the host's network stack. This means they can communicate with each other using localhost. Use this for extreme network performance. 
- awsvpc: Each task gets its own ENI and IP address. This is the preferred mode for Fargate. Each task receives a unique IP and ENI, allowing direct network access and improved isolation. No port mapping is required—containers can listen on any port. This mode provides the highest network performance and security. For EC2 launch type, the number of tasks is limited by the number of available ENIs on the instance. So check the number of ENIs per instance type. Make sure your vpc has lots of ip addresses. 
- none: No networking. Containers cannot communicate with each other or the host.

Load balancing for ECS:
- We use Bridge Networing mode and we get a dynamic port mapping 
- The ALB supports finding the right port on your ec2 instances 
- You must allow on the ec2 instance security group any ports from the ALB 

Load balancing for Fargate:
- We use awsvpc networking mode, so each task gets its own ENI and IP address.
- The ALB can route traffic directly to the task's IP and port.
- You must allow on the task's security group any ports from the ALB.

ECS Autoscaling:
- ECS can automatically scale your services up or down based on demand.
- You can define scaling policies based on CloudWatch metrics (e.g., CPU utilization).
- ECS will add or remove tasks to maintain the desired performance.
- CPU and RAM is tracked using CloudWatch metrics.
- Target tracking: Automatically adjusts the number of tasks based on a specified metric (e.g., CPU utilization).
- Step scaling: Allows you to define scaling actions based on a set of CloudWatch alarms.
- Scheduled scaling: Allows you to set scaling actions based on a schedule (e.g., scale up during business hours).
- In order to scale your ec2 clusters you use a capacity provider to determine the infrastructure that a task runs on
- For ECS and fargate users FARGATE AND FARGATE_SPOT capacity providers are added automatically 
- For Amazon ECS and EC2 you need to associate the capacity provider with an autoscaling group 
- When you run a task or service you define a capacity provider strategy to prioritize in which in which to run 
- This allows the capcity porovider to automatically provision infrastructure for you

You said:
what are capacity providers in aws ecs and how do they work?
ChatGPT said:
Great question 👍 Let’s break down Capacity Providers in AWS ECS in simple terms.

🔹 What are Capacity Providers?
Capacity providers in Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) are a way to control where and how your ECS tasks run.

They let you define and manage the compute capacity that ECS can use — whether that’s:

EC2 instances (your own cluster of EC2s running ECS agent), or

Fargate (serverless containers managed by AWS).

Instead of hardcoding tasks to "EC2" or "Fargate", you can attach capacity providers to a cluster and let ECS decide the best place to run tasks.

🔹 Types of Capacity Providers
EC2 Capacity Provider

Represents a set of EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling Group (ASG).

ECS manages scaling up/down the ASG based on the number of tasks.

Example: You define an ASG with 5–20 instances, ECS will scale it when tasks need more room.

Fargate Capacity Provider

Uses AWS Fargate to launch tasks with no EC2 management.

You can also use Fargate Spot (cheaper but interruptible).

🔹 How They Work
Attach providers to a cluster

A cluster can have multiple providers (e.g., one EC2 ASG + Fargate + Fargate Spot).

Define a Capacity Provider Strategy

When running a task/service, you specify a strategy that tells ECS how to pick a provider.

Strategy includes:

Base: Minimum number of tasks to place on a provider.

Weight: Relative percentage of tasks to place across providers.

Example:

Strategy:
  - Provider: FARGATE
    Base: 1
    Weight: 1
  - Provider: FARGATE_SPOT
    Weight: 2
👉 This means: Always put at least 1 task on Fargate, then put twice as many tasks on Fargate Spot as Fargate for the rest.

ECS manages placement

ECS will automatically launch tasks using the providers you configured.

If one provider runs out of capacity (say, Spot isn’t available), ECS can fall back to others.

🔹 Why Use Them?
Flexibility → Mix EC2, Fargate, and Spot in one cluster.

Cost Optimization → Prefer cheaper Spot when available, fallback to Fargate.

Automatic Scaling → ECS can grow/shrink your EC2 ASG automatically based on demand.

Separation of Concerns → Developers just deploy tasks, while infra engineers control where they land.

✅ In short:
Capacity providers abstract the compute layer in ECS. Instead of saying “run on EC2” or “run on Fargate,” you define capacity pools and strategies, and ECS intelligently places tasks across them.

Do you want me to also draw out a real-world analogy (like a restaurant kitchen setup) to make it even easier to visualize?

You said:
How do I do this on the console?
ChatGPT said:
Perfect 👌 Let’s go step by step on how to set up and use capacity providers in the AWS ECS console.

🔹 Step 1: Go to ECS Clusters
Sign in to the AWS Management Console.

Navigate to Amazon ECS → Clusters.

Choose (or create) a cluster where you want to use capacity providers.

🔹 Step 2: Attach Capacity Providers to the Cluster
When creating or editing a cluster:

Under Capacity providers, you’ll see options:

FARGATE

FARGATE_SPOT

(or your own EC2 Auto Scaling Group–based capacity provider if you’ve created one).

Select the ones you want.

Example: Choose FARGATE and FARGATE_SPOT.

👉 If you want EC2, you first need to:

Go to Auto Scaling Groups in the EC2 console.

Create an ASG with ECS-optimized AMIs.

Then go back to ECS → Capacity Providers → Create and link it to that ASG.

🔹 Step 3: Define a Capacity Provider Strategy
When you create a service or run a task:

On the Launch type step, instead of choosing Fargate or EC2, choose Capacity provider strategy.

Add providers and set Base and Weight values.

Example:

FARGATE → Base: 1, Weight: 1

FARGATE_SPOT → Weight: 2

This means: At least 1 task runs on Fargate, then tasks are distributed 2:1 on Spot vs Fargate.

🔹 Step 4: Run and Let ECS Handle Placement
When you deploy the service, ECS will place tasks according to the strategy.

If Spot capacity isn’t available, ECS falls back to the other provider.

📌 Quick Example in Console
Let’s say you want a web app service that uses cheap Spot but always keeps one task on standard Fargate:

Go to Clusters → Your Cluster → Create Service.

Choose Capacity provider strategy.

Add:

FARGATE (Base: 1, Weight: 1)

FARGATE_SPOT (Weight: 3)

Create the service.

ECS will now run:

1 guaranteed task on regular Fargate,

The rest (about 75%) on cheaper Spot.

⚡ That’s it! In the console, most of the heavy lifting is just selecting capacity providers on the cluster and then choosing a strategy when running tasks/services.

Do you want me to also show you how to create an EC2 capacity provider and link it to an Auto Scaling Group in the console, or are you focusing on Fargate/Fargate Spot only?

You said:
for ec2 clusters fargate and fargate_spot are greyed out
ChatGPT said:
Ahh, yes — that’s expected behavior 👍

Here’s what’s happening:

🔹 Why FARGATE and FARGATE_SPOT are greyed out
Cluster Type Matters

When you create an EC2 cluster (backed by EC2 instances), the console does not let you select Fargate or Fargate Spot.

That’s because Fargate is a serverless launch type — it doesn’t use your EC2 instances at all.

So on an EC2-backed cluster, only EC2 capacity providers (Auto Scaling Groups) are valid.

If you want to mix Fargate and EC2 in one cluster → you must create a new cluster with no default capacity provider, then attach both EC2 capacity providers (ASGs) and Fargate capacity providers.

🔹 What You Can Do for EC2
Create an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) with ECS-optimized AMIs.

EC2 → Auto Scaling Groups → Create → Pick ECS AMI → Register instances with your ECS cluster.

In ECS Console → Capacity Providers → Create, link that ASG to a new EC2 capacity provider.

Attach this provider to your cluster.

When you run a service/task → choose Capacity provider strategy and select your EC2 capacity provider(s).

🔹 If You Want Fargate/Fargate Spot
You need to use a Fargate-compatible cluster.

Go to Clusters → Create Cluster → Networking only (Fargate) option.

In that cluster, FARGATE and FARGATE_SPOT will be selectable.

✅ In short:

EC2 clusters → can only use EC2 capacity providers (ASGs).

Fargate clusters → can only use Fargate/Fargate Spot.

To mix both → create a cluster with no default capacity provider and attach them manually.

👉 Do you want me to walk you through how to set up an EC2 Auto Scaling Group and link it as a capacity provider step by step in the console?

You said:
So you have to create an asg first before creating the capacity provider?
ChatGPT said:
Exactly ✅

For EC2 capacity providers, the Auto Scaling Group (ASG) is the foundation.
Here’s the order of operations:

🔹 Why an ASG is required
An EC2 capacity provider is basically a wrapper around an Auto Scaling Group.

ECS uses the ASG to launch/terminate EC2 instances that register with the ECS cluster.

Without an ASG, ECS has no pool of EC2s to scale.

🔹 Step-by-Step Flow
Create an Auto Scaling Group (ASG)

Go to EC2 → Auto Scaling Groups → Create.

Launch template or config: choose an ECS-optimized AMI (Amazon Linux 2 ECS Optimized or Bottlerocket).

Make sure the User Data in the Launch Template has the ECS cluster name so instances auto-register.

Create a Capacity Provider in ECS

Go to ECS Console → Capacity Providers → Create.

Select EC2 Auto Scaling Group capacity provider.

Choose the ASG you just created.

Configure managed scaling (optional, lets ECS scale the ASG automatically).

Attach the Capacity Provider to your Cluster

ECS Console → Clusters → Your Cluster → Capacity Providers → Attach.

Use It in a Strategy

When creating a Service/Task → choose Capacity provider strategy → select your EC2 capacity provider.

You can mix multiple EC2 capacity providers (for different instance types, on-demand + spot, etc.).

✅ So yes: ASG first → then capacity provider → then attach to cluster.

Do you want me to give you a working example of the User Data script you need in the ASG launch template so the EC2s automatically join your ECS cluster?

You said:
Does the asg have to be creates with ecs ami?
ChatGPT said:
Great question 👌 — short answer: Yes, your ASG must launch instances with an ECS-compatible AMI, otherwise ECS won’t know how to register those EC2s into the cluster.

🔹 Why?
ECS agents run on the EC2s and talk back to the ECS control plane.

If you use an ECS-optimized AMI (Amazon Linux 2 ECS Optimized, Bottlerocket, etc.), the ECS agent is already installed and preconfigured.

If you use a plain Amazon Linux/Ubuntu AMI, the ECS agent is not there by default → you’d need to install and configure it manually in User Data.

🔹 Best Practice (Easiest Way)
Use one of the official ECS-optimized AMIs:

Amazon Linux 2 ECS-Optimized AMI

Amazon Linux 2023 with ECS agent (newer option)

Bottlerocket ECS-Optimized AMI (minimal container OS, good for performance)

AWS maintains these and updates them regularly.

🔹 If You Don’t Use ECS AMI
You can bring your own AMI, but then you must:

Install the ECS agent.

Configure it to connect to your ECS cluster.

Usually via User Data:

#!/bin/bash
echo "ECS_CLUSTER=my-ecs-cluster" >> /etc/ecs/ecs.config
Make sure Docker/Containerd and IAM permissions are set up properly.

That’s more work, and unless you have a specific customization need, it’s simpler to stick with ECS-optimized AMIs.

✅ So yes: the ASG should ideally be created with an ECS-optimized AMI.
That way your EC2s automatically register into your ECS cluster without extra setup.

Do you want me to show you the exact launch template setup (with User Data snippet) you’d need for your ASG if you go the ECS-optimized AMI route?

You said:
what are service autoscaling in aws ecs used for? Do they scalke the service or the tasks?
ChatGPT said:
Nice one 👍 — this is a really common point of confusion.

🔹 What Service Auto Scaling in ECS Does
Service Auto Scaling in Amazon ECS controls the number of tasks in your ECS service.

A service is basically a wrapper that keeps your desired number of tasks running.

Auto scaling adjusts that desired task count automatically based on load (CPU, memory, custom CloudWatch metrics, or even target tracking on ALB requests).

So → they scale tasks, not the service object itself.
The service definition doesn’t change — what changes is how many tasks it runs.

🔹 Example
Imagine you have an ECS service running a web app:

Minimum tasks: 2

Maximum tasks: 10

You enable service auto scaling with a target tracking policy like “keep CPU at ~50%.”

👉 What happens?

If traffic spikes and CPU goes to 80% → ECS increases the desired count (say, from 2 to 6 tasks).

If traffic drops and CPU stays at 10% → ECS scales down (maybe back to 2).

The service itself is still the same service — just running more or fewer tasks.

🔹 Difference vs. Capacity Provider (Cluster-level) Scaling
Service Auto Scaling = adjusts tasks per service.

Capacity Provider (managed scaling) = adjusts EC2 Auto Scaling Groups (the infrastructure).

These two can work together:

Service scaling says, “I need 10 tasks now.”

Capacity provider scaling says, “Okay, I’ll add more EC2s so those 10 tasks have space.”

✅ In short:

Service auto scaling = scales tasks within a service.

It does not create more services.

It often works in tandem with capacity provider scaling to ensure there’s enough EC2 (or Fargate) capacity to host those tasks.

Do you want me to also break down the different scaling policies (Target Tracking, Step Scaling, Scheduled Scaling) you can use for ECS services?

You said:
So capacituy providers adjust the ec2 instances running the tasks?
ChatGPT said:
Exactly 👍 you got it.

🔹 How Capacity Providers Fit In
Service Auto Scaling decides how many tasks should run.

Capacity Providers (with managed scaling) decide how many EC2 instances are needed to host those tasks.

🔹 Flow in Practice
Service auto scaling says:

“My service needs 10 tasks now (up from 4).”

ECS looks at the cluster capacity:

If the existing EC2 instances can fit all 10 → tasks are placed immediately.

If there isn’t enough room → capacity provider will scale out the underlying Auto Scaling Group to add EC2 instances.

When load decreases:

Service auto scaling reduces task count.

Capacity provider sees fewer tasks → scales the Auto Scaling Group back in (terminates unneeded EC2s).

🔹 Key Point
Service auto scaling = scales at the task level (application layer).

Capacity providers = scale the EC2 ASG level (infrastructure layer).

If you use Fargate/Fargate Spot capacity providers, you don’t worry about EC2s — AWS handles the infrastructure.

✅ So yes: Capacity providers are the mechanism ECS uses to adjust the EC2 instances that tasks run on (when you’re using EC2 launch type).

Would you like me to sketch out a diagram-style explanation (tasks ↔ service ↔ capacity provider ↔ EC2 ASG) so you can visualize how these layers interact?

You said:
How does service without autoscaling groups adjust the tasks then?
ChatGPT said:
Good catch 👌 — this is an important distinction.

Let’s split it up:

🔹 Case 1: ECS Service with Auto Scaling Group (EC2 launch type + capacity provider)
Service Auto Scaling decides how many tasks should run.

Capacity Provider (with managed scaling) adjusts the ASG so that enough EC2s exist to host those tasks.

🔹 Case 2: ECS Service without an Auto Scaling Group
This happens in two scenarios:

EC2 Cluster without managed scaling / no ASG

Service Auto Scaling can still change the number of tasks (desired count).

But → if there aren’t enough EC2 instances in the cluster to fit them, tasks may stay in PENDING and never start.

ECS won’t magically add more EC2s — you (or an external scaling policy) must do that.

👉 Example: You tell the service to run 10 tasks, but you only have EC2 capacity for 4. The other 6 sit in pending.

Fargate / Fargate Spot

Here, you don’t need an ASG.

Service Auto Scaling changes task count, and AWS automatically provisions the infrastructure (Fargate capacity) in the background.

That’s why in Fargate-only clusters, you never see “not enough capacity” errors unless you hit AWS’s soft service limits.

🔹 So in short
Service Auto Scaling always just adjusts task count.

If you’re on EC2, you need enough infrastructure (ASG + capacity provider) to support those tasks. Otherwise, they get stuck pending.

If you’re on Fargate, AWS provides the infrastructure, so tasks launch directly.

✅ Answer to your question:
A service without an Auto Scaling Group can still scale tasks up and down, but only within the capacity that already exists in the cluster. It cannot add/remove EC2s by itself.

Do you want me to also show you how to detect when tasks are stuck pending because of insufficient EC2 capacity (and how to fix it)?

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:
Perfect 👍 — let’s dig into how to spot when ECS tasks are stuck in PENDING because the cluster doesn’t have enough EC2s, and how to fix it.

🔹 How to Detect Stuck PENDING Tasks
1. Check ECS Console
Go to ECS → Clusters → Your Cluster → Tasks.

You’ll see tasks in the PENDING state.

Click a task → look at the Stopped reason / Status reason field.

If it says something like:

RESOURCE:MEMORY → not enough memory on any EC2 instance.

RESOURCE:CPU → not enough CPU.

RESOURCE:PORTS → required port already in use.

RESOURCE:GPU → no GPU available (common if you requested one).

These mean the cluster doesn’t have the right capacity.

2. Check Cluster → Metrics (CloudWatch)
In the ECS console, under Cluster → Metrics, look for:

CPUReservation

MemoryReservation

If these are near 100%, you’ve run out of resources.

3. Check EC2 Instances
Go to Cluster → ECS Instances.

If all instances are at high utilization, no place exists for new tasks.

Tasks wait in PENDING until you add more EC2s.

🔹 How to Fix It
Option 1: Manually Add EC2s
Increase the number of instances in your Auto Scaling Group (if you have one).

Or launch additional ECS-registered EC2 instances manually.

Option 2: Use a Capacity Provider with Managed Scaling
Attach your ASG as a capacity provider.

Enable Managed Scaling so ECS automatically adjusts the ASG size when tasks are pending.

Example: If you need 10 tasks and only 4 can fit, ECS will scale out the ASG to add more EC2s until all 10 tasks run.

Option 3: Use Fargate / Fargate Spot
Switch the service to Fargate → AWS handles the infrastructure.

No need to worry about EC2 instances at all.

🔹 Quick Example of a Real Issue
Let’s say you have:

An EC2 cluster with 2 t3.medium instances.

A service scaling up from 2 to 6 tasks.

👉 ECS says:

Task 1–4 fit on the existing instances.

Tasks 5 and 6 are stuck in PENDING with reason: RESOURCE:MEMORY.

✅ Fix: Either add more EC2s (scale ASG), or enable a capacity provider so ECS does that automatically.

Would you like me to also give you a step-by-step setup for enabling Managed Scaling on an ASG capacity provider, so ECS can fix pending tasks automatically without you intervening?

You said:
so capacity provider strategy of ec2 farghate ansd fargate_spot will scale the compute resources needed to run the tasks but the service asg will scale the number of tasks based on the scaling policy?
ChatGPT said:
Exactly — you’ve got it! 🎯 Let me break it down clearly so it’s crystal:

🔹 ECS Layers of Scaling
Service Auto Scaling (Scaling the Tasks)

What it does: Changes the desired number of tasks in a service.

How it works: Uses scaling policies (Target Tracking, Step Scaling, Scheduled Scaling) based on metrics like CPU, memory, or ALB request count.

Effect: More tasks run or fewer tasks run.

Scope: Application layer — only the tasks themselves.

Example:
Your service runs a web app with a target CPU of 50%. CPU spikes → ECS scales the tasks from 2 → 6.

Capacity Providers (Scaling the Compute Resources)

What it does: Ensures there’s enough compute infrastructure to host the tasks.

EC2 Capacity Provider: Adjusts the EC2 Auto Scaling Group size automatically (if Managed Scaling is enabled).

Fargate / Fargate Spot Capacity Provider: AWS automatically provisions the serverless compute needed for the tasks.

Scope: Infrastructure layer — adds/removes EC2 instances or Fargate compute.

Example:
Your service wants to run 6 tasks, but your EC2 cluster only has 4 instances → Capacity Provider scales out the ASG so all tasks can run.

🔹 How They Work Together
Layer	Controls	Notes
Service Auto Scaling	Number of tasks	Can be based on CPU, memory, requests, or custom metrics
Capacity Provider	Compute resources	EC2 instances (ASG) or Fargate capacity, auto-scales to meet task placement needs
Workflow:

Service policy increases tasks → ECS calculates resource needs.

Capacity provider checks if cluster has enough capacity → scales EC2 / Fargate as needed.

Tasks are placed on available capacity.

✅ So your statement is correct:

Service Auto Scaling → scales tasks

Capacity Provider (EC2 / Fargate / Fargate Spot) → scales compute resources

If you want, I can draw a diagram showing tasks, service, and capacity provider layers so it’s super easy to visualize. It usually clicks faster than words.

Do you want me to do that?

You said:
what happens if I use the default capacity provide for ec2 cluster does it scale up or down ?
ChatGPT said:
Ah, this is an important subtlety. Let’s break it down clearly:

🔹 Default EC2 Capacity Provider
When you create an EC2 ECS cluster, AWS automatically provides a default capacity provider that points to your cluster’s EC2 instances (if you didn’t create one explicitly).

Key points about the default capacity provider:

It does NOT automatically scale your EC2 instances by default.

The default is just a static mapping to your existing EC2 instances.

ECS can place tasks on them, but it won’t grow or shrink the EC2 fleet automatically.

Managed scaling is required for auto scaling of EC2s

If you want ECS to scale the EC2 instances up or down automatically, you must:

Create a capacity provider that references your Auto Scaling Group (ASG).

Enable Managed Scaling on that capacity provider.

Without managed scaling:

Tasks can still be scaled up or down via service auto scaling,

But tasks might get stuck in PENDING if the EC2 cluster doesn’t have enough capacity.

ECS won’t launch new EC2 instances automatically.

🔹 Summary Table
Feature	Default EC2 Capacity Provider	With Managed Scaling Enabled
Auto-scale EC2s	❌ No	✅ Yes
Tasks placement	✅ Yes (if enough capacity exists)	✅ Yes
Works with service auto scaling	✅ Yes, but limited by EC2 capacity	✅ Yes, EC2 capacity adjusts automatically
✅ So:

Default capacity provider alone → does NOT scale EC2 instances.

You need a capacity provider with managed scaling enabled if you want ECS to automatically add/remove EC2s to handle task scaling.

If you want, I can show you exact steps in the console to create a capacity provider with managed scaling so your EC2 cluster can scale automatically with your service.

You said:
How do you create a capacity provider that refernces an asg on the console?
ChatGPT said:
Perfect — here’s a step-by-step guide to creating an EC2 capacity provider that references an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) using the AWS ECS console:

🔹 Step 1: Create the Auto Scaling Group (if you don’t have one)
Go to the EC2 Console → Auto Scaling Groups → Create Auto Scaling Group.

Choose a launch template or configuration with an ECS-optimized AMI.

Set minimum, desired, and maximum instance counts.

Ensure User Data includes your ECS cluster name:

#!/bin/bash
echo "ECS_CLUSTER=my-ecs-cluster-name" >> /etc/ecs/ecs.config
Complete the ASG creation.

✅ At this point, ECS instances in this ASG can join the cluster.

🔹 Step 2: Create a Capacity Provider
Go to ECS Console → Capacity Providers → Create Capacity Provider.

Enter a name for your capacity provider.

Under Auto Scaling Group, select the ASG you just created.

Managed Scaling (optional, recommended):

Enable Managed Scaling to let ECS automatically scale the ASG based on task placement needs.

Set Target Capacity (%): the percentage of cluster resources to use before scaling out.

Example: 80% → ECS will add more EC2s when existing instances are 80% utilized.

Set Minimum and Maximum scaling limits for the ASG.

Managed Termination Protection (optional):

Prevent ECS from terminating instances with running tasks during scale-in.

Click Create.

🔹 Step 3: Attach Capacity Provider to Your Cluster
Go to ECS Console → Clusters → Your Cluster → Capacity Providers → Attach Capacity Provider.

Select the capacity provider you just created.

Optionally, set default capacity provider strategy for the cluster (weight, base, etc.).

Now your cluster can automatically scale EC2 instances to meet task placement demands.

🔹 Step 4: Use it in a Service
When creating or updating a service:

Under Launch Type → Capacity Provider Strategy, select your EC2 capacity provider.

Set Base and Weight to control how tasks are distributed across capacity providers.

✅ Result:

Tasks scale according to your service scaling policy.

ECS automatically adjusts the ASG size to make sure there’s enough EC2 capacity.

If you want, I can make a quick diagram showing how the service, capacity provider, and ASG interact, which usually makes this much easier to visualize.

Do you want me to do that?

You said:
Can I update an existing capacity provider?
ChatGPT said:
Yes — you can update an existing capacity provider in AWS ECS, but there are some limitations depending on what you want to change.

Here’s how it works:

🔹 What You Can Update
For an EC2 capacity provider (linked to an ASG):

Managed Scaling settings

Enable or disable Managed Scaling.

Change Target Capacity (%), Minimum / Maximum scaling limits, Instance Warm-up time, etc.

Managed Termination Protection

Turn it on or off to prevent ECS from terminating instances during scale-in.

✅ These are the most common things you’d update.

🔹 What You Cannot Change
You cannot change the ASG itself once the capacity provider is created.

If you want a different ASG, you must create a new capacity provider linked to that ASG.

You cannot rename the capacity provider.

🔹 How to Update in the Console
Go to ECS Console → Capacity Providers.

Click on the capacity provider you want to update.

Click Edit.

Update any Managed Scaling or Managed Termination Protection settings.

Save changes.

Changes take effect immediately for any new tasks placed after the update.

🔹 Additional Tip
If your cluster is using this capacity provider as part of the default capacity provider strategy, any changes to weights or base will automatically influence new services or task placements.

If you want, I can also explain how updating a capacity provider affects running services and tasks — that’s something many people get tripped up on.

Do you want me to go into that?

You said:
Set target capacity %
Info
When managed scaling is turned on, the target capacity value is used as the target value for the CloudWatch metric used in the Amazon ECS-managed target tracking scaling policy. For example, a value of 100 will result in the Amazon EC2 instances in your Auto Scaling group being completely utilized.
100
ChatGPT said:
Exactly — that Target Capacity % is how ECS decides when to scale your EC2 instances up or down. Let me break it down clearly:

🔹 What “Target Capacity %” Means
It’s a percentage of cluster capacity (CPU + memory) that ECS tries to maintain before adding or removing EC2 instances.

ECS uses it with a CloudWatch metric in a managed target tracking policy behind the scenes.

🔹 How It Works
Target Capacity %	Behavior
100%	ECS will try to fully utilize all EC2 instances before scaling out. Tasks may be waiting in PENDING if there isn’t enough room until more instances are added.
80%	ECS will keep your EC2 cluster 80% utilized. It will scale out earlier, so tasks don’t wait for free capacity.
50%	ECS keeps cluster lightly utilized → scales out aggressively to ensure plenty of free capacity.
🔹 Example
Suppose your ASG has 4 t3.medium instances, each with 2 vCPU and 4 GB RAM:

Service scales from 4 → 8 tasks.

ECS looks at Target Capacity = 80%.

Current instances are 80% utilized → ECS triggers the ASG to add more EC2 instances.

Tasks can now be placed immediately without waiting.

🔹 Key Points
Higher % → fewer instances added, higher utilization, but risk tasks get stuck pending.

Lower % → more instances added proactively, lower utilization, more cost.

ECS automatically scales EC2 instances in the ASG to meet the target capacity for the tasks.

If you want, I can make a small visual example showing how Target Capacity % affects scaling out the EC2 cluster — it usually makes this concept click instantly.

Do you want me to do that?

You said:
why do I have a min size of 1 and max size of 5 but have a desired of 2 in my capsacity providers? Where is that from or how do I override that to 1
ChatGPT said:
Ah yes — that can be a little confusing at first. Let’s clarify what each of these numbers means and why you see them in your capacity provider:

🔹 EC2 Capacity Provider Numbers Explained
Minimum size (Min)

The minimum number of EC2 instances the Auto Scaling Group (ASG) will ever maintain.

ECS cannot scale below this.

Maximum size (Max)

The maximum number of EC2 instances the ASG can scale up to.

ECS cannot launch more than this number.

Desired capacity

The current number of EC2 instances that the ASG tries to maintain initially.

This comes from the ASG configuration itself, not from ECS.

When you create a capacity provider, it inherits the desired count from the underlying ASG.

So in your case:

Min = 1

Max = 5

Desired = 2 → this is the current ASG desired instance count.

🔹 How to Override Desired Capacity
The desired capacity is controlled by the Auto Scaling Group, not ECS directly. You have a few options:

Edit the ASG directly (simplest)

Go to EC2 Console → Auto Scaling Groups → Your ASG → Edit.

Change Desired capacity from 2 → 1.

ECS will now see the capacity provider reflecting the new desired count.

Let ECS managed scaling control it

If Managed Scaling is enabled on the capacity provider, ECS will ignore the ASG desired count and scale based on Target Capacity % automatically.

In this case, the ASG desired count is just a starting point — ECS adjusts it as tasks are placed.

🔹 Important Note
Min size = hard lower limit

Max size = hard upper limit

Desired = starting point or current count

ECS won’t scale below min, even if you try to override desired to 0.

✅ In short:

That “2” you see is coming from the ASG configuration, not ECS itself.

To make the desired capacity 1, you either edit the ASG or rely on ECS managed scaling to dynamically adjust it.

If you want, I can show you a step-by-step way to safely reduce the ASG desired capacity to 1 without affecting running tasks.

Do you want me to do that?

You said:
but now I set a target capacity of 70% on the capacity provider. What does that mean?
ChatGPT said:
Perfect — let’s break down exactly what Target Capacity = 70% means in your EC2 capacity provider:

🔹 What Target Capacity % Means
Target Capacity % is part of ECS managed scaling for the capacity provider.

It tells ECS how much of your cluster’s EC2 resources should be “used” before scaling out.

Think of it as:

“Keep the cluster around 70% utilized. If usage goes above this, add EC2 instances. If usage drops well below this, remove EC2 instances.”

🔹 How It Works in Practice
Suppose your cluster has an ASG of t3.medium instances:

Each instance: 2 vCPU + 4 GB RAM

ASG Min = 1, Max = 5

Desired = 1

ECS Target Capacity = 70%

Scenario 1: Scaling out

Service wants to run tasks that use 1.5 instances worth of resources.

Cluster is currently at 1 instance → ~100% used.

ECS sees usage > 70% target → scales ASG out (launches another EC2).

New instance joins → cluster now ~50% utilized → tasks placed successfully.

Scenario 2: Scaling in

Task count decreases → only 1 task remains.

Cluster is lightly used → usage well below 70% target.

ECS can scale ASG down → remove unneeded EC2 instances, respecting ASG min size (1 instance).

🔹 Key Points
Higher % (e.g., 100%) → scale out later, instances are highly utilized → cost-efficient but risk tasks pending.

Lower % (e.g., 50%) → scale out earlier → more capacity, lower risk of pending tasks, but higher cost.

Target Capacity doesn’t affect tasks → it only affects how the underlying EC2 instances are scaled.

✅ In short:

Target Capacity = 70% → ECS will try to keep your EC2 instances ~70% utilized.

If utilization goes above 70%, ECS adds more instances.

If utilization goes below 70%, ECS may remove instances (never below ASG min).

If you want, I can make a diagram showing tasks, ASG instances, and how Target Capacity controls scaling — it usually makes this concept click instantly.

Do you want me to do that?

You said:
How can I increase cpu on a container to test if the service autoscaling works?
ChatGPT said:
Perfect — yes, you can temporarily increase the CPU allocated to a container to test whether your service auto scaling policy reacts. Here’s how to do it safely:

🔹 Step 1: Update the Task Definition
Go to ECS Console → Task Definitions → Select your task definition → Create new revision.

Find the container you want to test.

Update the CPU field:

ECS uses CPU units.

1024 CPU units = 1 vCPU.

512 CPU units = 0.5 vCPU.

Example: If current CPU = 256 → increase to 1024 to create high CPU usage demand.

Save and create a new revision.

🔹 Step 2: Update the Service to Use the New Revision
Go to ECS Console → Clusters → Your Service → Update.

Choose the new task definition revision.

Keep the same desired count (don’t change it).

Update the service.

ECS will gradually replace existing tasks with the new revision.

🔹 Step 3: Generate Load (Optional)
If your service uses CPU as the scaling metric, increasing CPU allocation might not trigger scaling immediately unless the tasks actually consume CPU.

To test quickly:

Run a CPU stress test inside the container. For example:

# Install stress if needed
apt-get update && apt-get install -y stress
# Stress CPU with 1 core for 60s
stress --cpu 1 --timeout 60
This will spike CPU usage → your service auto scaling policy should kick in.

🔹 Step 4: Observe Auto Scaling
Go to ECS → Clusters → Service → Auto Scaling → Activity History

You should see tasks being added according to the scaling policy you configured.

🔹 Notes
After testing, revert to the original CPU setting to avoid over-provisioning and extra cost.

If scaling doesn’t trigger:

Make sure your scaling policy is using the CPU metric (or whichever metric you’re stressing).

Check that minimum and maximum task counts allow scaling.

✅ In short:

Update container CPU in task definition.

Deploy new revision to the service.

Generate CPU load inside the container.

Observe ECS scaling.

If you want, I can also give you a quick one-line CPU stress command that works on most Linux ECS containers for testing.

Do you want me to do that?

You said:
why does asg keep updating its desired capacity to 2 by itslef?
ChatGPT said:
Ah — this is a very common source of confusion with ECS capacity providers + ASGs. Let me explain exactly why your ASG keeps reverting its desired capacity to 2.

🔹 Why the ASG Desired Capacity Changes Automatically
Managed Scaling in the ECS Capacity Provider

When you enable Managed Scaling on a capacity provider, ECS takes control of the ASG desired capacity.

ECS adjusts the desired capacity automatically to maintain the Target Capacity % you set.

The ASG is effectively “owned” by ECS for scaling purposes while Managed Scaling is on.

CloudWatch Target Tracking

ECS creates a CloudWatch target tracking policy behind the scenes.

This policy sets the ASG desired capacity so that cluster utilization stays near the target (e.g., 70%).

The ASG “desired” value will fluctuate automatically as ECS adds or removes instances to meet task placement needs.

Your manual change gets overwritten

If you try to manually set desired = 1, ECS will override it to match its managed scaling target based on current tasks + target capacity %.

🔹 Example Scenario
Min size = 1, Max = 5

Target Capacity = 70%

Current tasks require ~1.4 instances to run efficiently

What happens:

You manually set ASG desired = 1

ECS sees that 1 instance is not enough to maintain 70% utilization

ECS automatically updates desired → 2

Tasks get scheduled successfully

This behavior is normal for capacity providers with managed scaling.

🔹 How to Control It
If you want ECS to manage the ASG automatically → don’t try to override desired manually. Let ECS do it.

If you want a fixed desired count → disable Managed Scaling on the capacity provider.

Then ECS will place tasks only on the existing EC2 instances and won’t adjust the ASG.

Tasks may remain in PENDING if the cluster doesn’t have enough capacity.

✅ In short:

ASG keeps updating itself to 2 because ECS Managed Scaling is controlling it to meet the Target Capacity %.

Manual changes to desired capacity are ignored while Managed Scaling is enabled.

If you want, I can make a diagram showing how ECS managed scaling updates the ASG based on tasks and target capacity, which usually makes this behavior very clear.

Do you want me to do that?

You said:
But Im only at 50% on the current instance why does it keep scaling it out
ChatGPT said:
Ah — now this makes sense. When ECS scales out the ASG even though your current instance is only 50% utilized, it usually comes down to how ECS calculates “utilization” for the target capacity. Let me explain:

🔹 Why ECS Might Scale Out Early
Target Capacity % is cluster-wide, not per-instance

ECS calculates CPU and memory utilization across all instances in the cluster, but it also considers how many tasks could be placed.

If the next task(s) can’t fit on the existing instance, ECS scales out even if average utilization is below the target.

Example:

Instance has 50% CPU free.

Next task requires 60% CPU → ECS can’t fit it → ASG scales out.

Task Placement Needs

ECS must respect task CPU and memory reservations.

If the instance can’t accommodate the next task’s CPU/memory combination, ECS triggers a scale-out.

This is common when tasks have fixed CPU/memory units, and the free resources are fragmented.

Target Capacity vs. Desired Tasks

Target Capacity = 70% → ECS wants 70% of cluster resources “used” by tasks.

If ECS sees that adding a new instance is required to keep tasks placed correctly while staying near 70% utilization, it will scale out preemptively.

Minimum size / scaling buffer

ECS sometimes adds an extra instance to ensure smooth task placement and avoid pending tasks, even if the average utilization is below target.

🔹 How to Confirm
Go to ECS Console → Clusters → Cluster → Capacity Providers → Managed Scaling Activity

You’ll see entries like “Increasing desired capacity to place pending tasks”

It will tell you why ECS added the instance (usually insufficient memory or CPU for new tasks).

Check task CPU/memory requirements vs available instance resources.

Often, even 50% free doesn’t allow the next task to fit neatly.

🔹 Key Point
ECS scaling is task-aware, not just instance-average-aware.

Even if average CPU = 50%, ECS may scale out to avoid pending tasks if no single instance can fit the next task.

✅ Summary:

ECS scales out based on task placement feasibility, target capacity, and available resources, not purely on average instance utilization.

This is normal behavior when using Managed Scaling.

If you want, I can show a small diagram/example with tasks and a single EC2 instance to illustrate why ECS adds another instance even when CPU is only 50%.

Do you want me to do that?

From the events you shared, this is exactly what’s happening:
🔹 Why the ASG keeps flipping between 1 and 2
User manually set desired capacity = 1
Event: user request update of AutoScalingGroup … desired: 1
Result: ASG terminates or stops extra instances to match 1. ✅
ECS Managed Scaling triggers
Event: monitor alarm … in state ALARM triggered policy ECSManagedAutoScalingPolicy … changing desired capacity from 1 to 2
ECS sees that current cluster utilization or pending tasks require more capacity to meet the Target Capacity %.
It automatically increases ASG desired capacity to 2 to satisfy the target. ✅
Cycle repeats
Every time you manually adjust ASG desired capacity, ECS Managed Scaling can override it immediately if the cluster is under-provisioned for task placement.
🔹 Key Takeaways
The ASG desired capacity is controlled by ECS Managed Scaling, not manual edits, while Managed Scaling is enabled.
Your manual changes are temporary and will be overridden if ECS thinks more instances are needed.
ECS doesn’t just look at average CPU — it looks at task placement feasibility + Target Capacity % when deciding to scale out.
🔹 How to Stop the ASG from overriding
Disable Managed Scaling on the capacity provider.
ECS will no longer adjust ASG desired capacity automatically.
You’ll have to manually manage ASG size.
Keep Managed Scaling enabled but adjust Target Capacity
If 70% target is too aggressive and causing scale-outs, increase it closer to 100% so ECS only scales when the cluster is nearly full.
✅ In short:
ECS Managed Scaling is intentionally overriding your manual desired capacity to maintain task placement and target utilization.
That’s why it keeps changing between 1 and 2.
If you want, I can explain a safe way to test a desired capacity of 1 while still keeping Managed Scaling enabled, so ECS won’t immediately override it. Do you want me to do that?
You said:
Can I also change the instance type to give it more room?
ChatGPT said:
Yes — you can change the EC2 instance type in your Auto Scaling Group to give tasks more CPU/memory capacity, but there are some details to keep in mind:
🔹 How It Works
Why you’d change the instance type
ECS schedules tasks based on CPU and memory reservations.
If your current instances are too small, tasks may not fit even though average utilization is low.
Using a larger instance type (more vCPUs or RAM) gives more room per instance, reducing the need for ECS to scale out.
Changing the instance type in an ASG
Go to EC2 → Auto Scaling Groups → Your ASG → Edit.
Change the Launch Template / Launch Configuration to use a larger instance type.
For launch templates:
Create a new version of the template with the new instance type.
Update the ASG to use the new template version.
For launch configurations:
Create a new launch configuration with the new type.
Update the ASG to use it.
Rolling update to replace old instances
Once the ASG uses the new launch template/configuration:
ECS will gradually replace old instances (smaller type) with new ones (larger type) if you do a rolling update.
Old instances will be terminated respecting Managed Scaling and termination protection.
🔹 Important Notes
Cost: Larger instance types cost more.
Placement: ECS may still scale out if the new instances don’t fit task placement perfectly (depends on task CPU/memory).
Managed Scaling: ECS will continue adjusting the ASG desired capacity automatically unless you disable it.
✅ In short:
Changing the instance type is a valid way to give more room for tasks.
Do it by updating your launch template/configuration in the ASG.
ECS will place tasks on the new instances and may scale less aggressively if the larger instances fit more tasks.
If you want, I can outline a safe step-by-step procedure to switch your ASG to a larger instance type without causing downtime for your running tasks.
Do you want me to do that?
You said:
So the 70% here is how much of the resources in the instance has been used correct? But if ecs sees that the next tasks will require more it scales out?
ChatGPT said:
Exactly — you’ve got it! ✅ Let me clarify precisely how it works:
🔹 Target Capacity % vs Task Placement
Target Capacity %
This is how much of the cluster’s resources ECS wants to keep “in use”.
ECS calculates this using CPU and memory reservations of the tasks across all instances.
Example:
You have 1 instance with 4 vCPU + 8 GB RAM.
Target Capacity = 70% → ECS wants tasks to consume roughly 2.8 vCPU and 5.6 GB RAM.
Task Placement Consideration
ECS doesn’t just look at average utilization.
It checks whether the next task(s) can fit on any available instance.
Even if average utilization is below 70%, if no instance has enough contiguous free CPU/memory for the new task, ECS will scale out the ASG to add more instances.
🔹 Example Scenario
Current instance: 4 vCPU, 8 GB RAM
Running tasks: use 50% CPU, 4 GB RAM
Next task requires 3 vCPU and 4 GB RAM
What happens:
Average CPU utilization = 50% → below target capacity (70%)
ECS sees the next task cannot fit on the existing instance
ECS triggers scale-out → ASG desired capacity increases to launch another instance
New task is placed successfully
🔹 Key Points
Target Capacity = cluster-wide utilization goal
Scale-out triggers = task placement feasibility
ECS combines both to decide when to launch more EC2 instances
That’s why sometimes the ASG scales out even though the current instance is “underutilized” on averag
✅ In short:
70% is the utilization target ECS tries to maintain
Scale-out can happen earlier if new tasks cannot fit on existing instances
If you want, I can make a small diagram showing tasks, instance resources, and how ECS decides to scale out even under 70% utilization — it makes this behavior very clear.
Do you want me to do that?
You said:
One more time service asg scales in or out the task right?
ChatGPT said:
Good question — let’s separate the two clearly because this trips up a lot of people:
1. Service Auto Scaling (Task Scaling)
Controls the number of tasks in your service.
Example:
Scale-out policy: if CPU > 70% → increase task count by +1.
Scale-in policy: if CPU < 30% → decrease task count by -1.
This does not touch EC2 instances at all — it only says “I want N tasks running.”
2. Capacity Provider / ASG Scaling (Compute Scaling)
Ensures there are enough EC2 instances to place those tasks.
ECS tells the ASG, “Hey, I need more room for tasks.”
The ASG then adjusts desired capacity (instance count).
🔹 How they work together
Service Auto Scaling: scales the tasks (app replicas).
Capacity Provider Scaling (ASG): scales the instances (compute capacity) to fit those tasks.
So:
👉 Service auto scaling = number of tasks
👉 ASG (via capacity provider) = number of instances
✅ To your question:
Service Auto Scaling scales the tasks.
ASG scaling scales the instances.
Do you want me to show you a flow example, like “task scales out → instance scales out → service balances again” in a step-by-step scenario?

Amazon ECR:
  - Container Registry for Docker images
  - Fully managed, scalable, and secure
  - Integrates with ECS for seamless deployments
  - Store manage and deploy containers on AWS 
  - Pay what you use
  - Fully integrated with AWS ECS, backed internally by AWS S3 
  - Supports image vulnerability scanning, versioning, tag, image lifecycle 
  - Allowed 1 registry per account per region
  - to login you run the command 
  ```
  aws ecr get-login-password --region <region> | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com
  ``` 
  - The ECR workflow goes as such: 
  1. Get authentication token /link docker cli to ECR
  2. Create repository 
  3. build an image  
  4. Tag the image 
  5. Push the image to ECR 
  To update the image repeat steps 3-5
